            <h2>Project 1</h2>
            <p>Solar Water System Control using ESP32 Microcontroller

				This project was an innovative solution aimed at automating the irrigation of plants using solar power. As the project lead, I managed a team to design and develop an efficient and reliable watering system. Key aspects of this project included:
				
				Design and Development: Spearheaded the design of the control system using the ESP32 microcontroller, which involved selecting appropriate sensors and components for soil moisture detection and water level monitoring.
				Programming and Integration: Developed the firmware for the ESP32 to handle real-time data from soil moisture sensors and control the irrigation system. Integrated IoT capabilities to allow remote monitoring and adjustments through a web interface.
				Testing and Optimization: Conducted rigorous testing to ensure the system operated reliably under different conditions. Implemented optimizations to enhance system efficiency, such as minimizing energy consumption and ensuring accurate water distribution.
				Outcome: Successfully created a sustainable solution that reduced manual watering efforts and ensured optimal plant growth. The project demonstrated my skills in embedded systems, IoT integration, and practical application of microcontroller programming.</p>
				<h3>Project 2</h3>
				<p>Android Controlled Wildlife Observation Robot</p>
				<p>This project focused on developing a robot capable of being controlled via an Android application for monitoring wildlife in their natural habitats. My role included:

					Project Leadership: Led the development team, overseeing all stages of the project from concept to implementation. Coordinated with team members to ensure all components were integrated seamlessly.
					Robot Design and Sensor Integration: Designed the robot’s hardware, including the integration of sensors and cameras. Selected high-resolution cameras and environmental sensors to capture detailed data and ensure real-time observations.
					Android Application Development: Developed an Android application to control the robot remotely. Implemented features such as real-time video streaming, sensor data display, and control commands for maneuvering the robot.
					Real-time Data Processing: Implemented algorithms for processing and analyzing the data collected by the sensors. Enabled the robot to stream live video and provide insights into wildlife behavior and habitat conditions.
					Outcome: The project provided a valuable tool for wildlife researchers and enthusiasts, offering a non-intrusive way to observe and study wildlife. It showcased my expertise in robotics, Android development, real-time data streaming, and sensor technology.</p>
